# CVs, Academic Papers and Research Summary  

Here you can find a collection of my academic and private CV, my academic papers and a summary of my research.


Note for me: To publish it on https://nbviewer.jupyter.org in order to avoid Google Drive, go to the website and paste the URL of the .pdf file from the GitHub page, 
then copy and paste the link wherever you weant this to be added. This is how I added CV and research summary on my personal website.
